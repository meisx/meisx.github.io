            <div class = "text">Hi, I'm Mei Mei! <br><br>I'm a fourth year studying Political Science at UC Berkeley. I'm currently organizing the Reach Grow Build (RGB) speaker series and leading a design team at  <a class = "links" href ="https://innovativedesign.club" target = "_blank">Innovative Design</a>. In addition, I am a graphic designer for the Plant and Microbial Biology department. Previously, I organized two iterations of <a class = "links" href = "https://calhacks.io/" target = "_blank">Cal Hacks</a> and directed AFX Dance, the largest urban dance organization at Berkeley. <br><br> In my free time, I enjoy photography, dancing, and politics. I'd love to chat about these topics and more; feel free to reach out at anytime! <br><br> Hey, if you're in Berkeley and looking for tea/boba or a place to study, stop by Asha Tea House and visit your favorite barista!
