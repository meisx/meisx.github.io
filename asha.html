			<br>
			<div class = "description">
				I currently work part-time at this quaint tea house in Berkeley, CA. We recently celebrated our five year anniversary, and the owners renovated the store and rebranded the logo. Inspired partially by the rebranding, I decided to do my own take on Asha's designs and marketing materials. 
			</div>
			<br><br>			
			<br>
			<div class = "subheader"><b>Why Rebrand?</b></div>
			<div class = "description">
				Asha has kept its original branding since opening in 2012. The Berkeley store has recently been remodeled and the menu/catalogs redesigned. With the opening of a third location, it is important to bring a fresh but nonetheless consistent branding and energy.
			</div><br>
			<div class = "subheader"><b>Current Design</b></div>
			<div class = "description">
				Plusses: the design is clean and minimal; it features teapot which is consistent with store motto ("darn good tea").<br>
				Deltas: the design is almost too cute; the "Tea Guy" is oftentimes mistaken for a panda; as not professional/sophiscated as originally desired.
			</div><br>
			<div class = "subheader"><b>Ideation + Sketches</b></div>
			<div class = "description">
				Incorporate matcha (one of Asha's signature drinks), ideally the whisk into the design.<br>
				Cut-out white edges/retro vibes
				Nature-y themed colors: greens (bamboo/tea leaves), beige/browns (teaware).
